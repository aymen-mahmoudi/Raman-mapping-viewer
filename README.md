# Raman mapping viewer


## Description
Labspec software, as far as I know, still has a bug when saving mapping data under raster images in high-quality export. Nevertheless, it is always possible to save the table of data in text format. Via this project, I created a solution to open this mapping data under different tunable color maps. 
A visual interface, as well as a notebook file solution, are available for direct use.

The graphical interface allows a direct presentation of the map data after a loading of the txt file. The first notebook allows a plotting of the mapping in normal or binary mode. The second one allows the combination of two maps by performing arithmetic operations. This can be very useful to highlight the wanted information vis-Ã -vis the contribution of different peaks.

## Installation
To run the main file or the notebook files, I recommend to setup a python virtual environment (tested and verified under 3.8.0 version) and adding the required libraries using the following command after cloning the rep (you can just download the rep in case you don't use git):
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
The usage of the graphical interface, as well as the notebook files, is super user-friendly; you have to choose the map color you prefer, tune the maximum and minimum values, and click Redraw to apply changes.

## Roadmap
 <ul>
  <li>Perform arithmetic operations in the graphical interface</li>
  <li>More coloring options (gamma, etc)</li>
  <li>Add segmentation, second derivative options, etc</li>
  <li>Transform the project on a desktop application</li>
</ul>
